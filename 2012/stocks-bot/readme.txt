Stocks bot 3000 - engineered to lose

1. Set USERNAME and PASSWORD in bot.py to some user and pw (UB-*****).
2. OPTIONAL: Go into command.py and change Tetris- to your name (capitalize first letter)
3. Run bot.py.
4. ????
5. LOSS

PS. Ok seriously, put in at least 100k to 1 mill or else it's gonna "bite the dust." Expect a 20% (MINIMUM, and I'm underestimating) loss within two weeks. UB-Stocks had 700k, of which 350k was mine.

Then again, as long as people don't cash out, you win.
